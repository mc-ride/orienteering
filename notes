orienteering - TSP with a limit on weight traveled; find highest total reward. also called bank robber's problem (maybe only with deadlines).

heuristic:
1. elliptical subset: 
major axis <- tmax
f1, f2 <- start, end points
subset is points that are on/in the ellipse

2. initialization:
greedily add shortest path, ignoring reward
create 10 or len( subset ) paths, whichever is shortest:
	find first 10 closest points (or all points) to start and end points
